# Redmine: Flexible Project Management

Companies and teams have increasingly faced the difficulties of establishing a good KM (Knowledge Management) with "management-valuable" accurate KPIs. Often, paid "Issue Manager Systems" do not cover all the needs nor address specific business rules gaps of a team and its collaborators. This is one of many reasons for the strength of open-sourcing and developments under the GPLv2 licensing.

And then I met [Redmine](https://www.redmine.org/) ‚ù§Ô∏è

Redmine is a flexible, open-source project management and issue-tracking tool written using the [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) framework. It is licensed under the GPLv2, which makes it freely available and allows for extensive customization to suit various business needs.
